# DevOps Lab 1: CI/CD Fundamentals

## Introduction
Version control plays a crucial role in software development, ensuring efficient tracking of modifications. Git, a distributed version control system, helps developers manage their code history. GitHub extends Git by providing a cloud-based repository hosting service with enhanced collaboration features.

## Understanding Git Workflow
1. **Local Repository**: Each developer maintains a personal copy of the project on their system.
2. **Staging Area**: Modifications are prepared for commit in the staging area.
3. **Commit History**: Every commit captures a snapshot of the codebase.
4. **Remote Synchronization**: Changes can be pushed and pulled between local and remote repositories hosted on GitHub.
5. **Team Collaboration**: Developers coordinate through branching, pull requests, and merging strategies.

## Essential Git Operations

### Configuring Git
```sh
# Define user details globally
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
```

### Initializing a Repository
```sh
# Create a new Git repository
git init
```

### Cloning an Existing Repository
```sh
# Copy a repository from GitHub
git clone <repo-url>
```

### Checking Repository Status
```sh
git status
```

### Staging Files for Commit
```sh
# Stage all modified files
git add .
# Stage a specific file
git add <filename>
```

### Committing Changes
```sh
# Save changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

### Pushing Changes to Remote Repository
```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Fetching Latest Changes from Remote Repository
```sh
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### Creating and Managing Branches
```sh
# Create a new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Merging Branches
```sh
# Integrate changes from another branch
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Submitting a Pull Request on GitHub
1. Push the branch to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository online.
3. Click **Compare & pull request**.
4. Add relevant details and submit the pull request.
